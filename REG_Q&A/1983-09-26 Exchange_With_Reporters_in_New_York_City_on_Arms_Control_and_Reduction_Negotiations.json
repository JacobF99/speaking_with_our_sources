  "Title: Exchange With Reporters in New York City on Arms Control and Reduction Negotiations"
  "Q. Has Ambassador Nitze had any response, sir, following your new initiatives to the Soviets?
The President. What's that?"
  "Q. Has Ambassador Nitze had any response in Geneva yet on your new initiative?"
  "The President. Not that I know of, no, because this is the first time that we publicly voiced them."
  "Q. He gave it to them earlier, I think."
  "The President. I assume that he did. I've heard nothing officially."
  "Q. Good to see you.
The President. Thank you."
