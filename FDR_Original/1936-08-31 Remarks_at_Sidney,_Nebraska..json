  "Title: Remarks at Sidney, Nebraska."
  "I am sorry that the Governor is not here because of illness, but I expect to see him in Des Moines next Thursday. I am glad that the State is so well represented by my old friend, Congressman Coffee, who is with us today."
  "I want particularly to learn something at first hand about what you have done in this part of the State in relation to summer fallowing. As I understand it, you have taken the lead in this, and that is at least partly responsible for your making as much as a 20 percent crop. There are a great many sections of the country that have not made any crop."
  "I want also to hear about the progress of the cattle-purchasing program here on the part of the Federal Government."
  "All of these things are tying in together. I am confident that we shall have in this State the same fine cooperation on the part of local government and its citizens with the State and Federal Governments that I have found everywhere I have gone on my travels."
