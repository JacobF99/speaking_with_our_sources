  "Date: November 07, 1942"
  "Title: Radio Address to the French People on the North African Invasion."
  "Americans, with the assistance of the United Nations, are striving for their own safe future as well as the restoration of the ideals, the liberties, and the democracy of all those who have lived under the Tricolor."
  "We come among you to repulse the cruel invaders who would remove forever your rights of self-government, your rights to religious freedom, and your rights to live your own lives in peace and security."
  "We come among you solely to defeat and rout your enemies. Have faith in our words. We do not want to cause you any harm."
  "We assure you that once the menace of Germany and Italy is removed from you, we shall quit your territory at once."
  "I am appealing to your realism, to your self-interest and national ideals.
Do not obstruct, I beg of you, this great purpose."
  "Help us where you are able, my friends, and we shall see again the glorious day when liberty and peace shall reign again on earth.
Vive la France eternelle!"
