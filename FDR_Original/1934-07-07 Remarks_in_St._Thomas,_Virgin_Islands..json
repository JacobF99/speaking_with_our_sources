  "Title: Remarks in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands."
  "The experiment that we are working out in the Virgin Islands is being watched by Washington with a great deal of interest. We have a unit in the Virgin Islands where we can actually see the results of their work. I am very proud of what you have done. I hope to come here again before I leave Washington and see some more of these fine results. I am glad to see you all."
