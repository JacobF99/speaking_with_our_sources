  "Date: November 10, 1944"
  "Title: Remarks to the Crowd Greeting the President at Union Station, Washington, D.C."
  "All these years—eight in the Navy Department, twelve in the White House—and four to come—will have a great effect on Washington. The city is very different from the Washington that I first came to in the first administration of President Cleveland."
  "So I want to tell you how glad I am to be here and say one word to you- especially the Government workers- for all that you are doing to win this war. And when I say especially Government workers, I don't overlook all the other people in the city who make it possible for them to come here and live here and work here."
  "So thanks very much."
