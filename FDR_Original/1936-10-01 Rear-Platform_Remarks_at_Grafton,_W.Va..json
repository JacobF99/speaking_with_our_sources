  "Title: Rear-Platform Remarks at Grafton, W.Va."
  "I am told by the engineer in charge that here in Grafton there are no people who want work who cannot get work. And so, as has been well said on a number of occasions this morning on the train, we are not here to defend the New Deal, we are here to proclaim it."
  "This is a very different sight from what I saw in West Virginia in 1932. I believe the country is well on the way not only toward recovery, but toward the kind of recovery that is going to stay."
