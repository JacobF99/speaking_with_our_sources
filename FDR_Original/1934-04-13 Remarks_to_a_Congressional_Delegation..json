  "Title: Remarks to a Congressional Delegation."
  "Well, anyway, I wish you had had the chance I had to get away for two weeks because I did have a wonderful holiday and I have come back with all sorts of new lessons which I learned from barracuda and sharks. I am a tough guy. So, if you will come down and see me as often as you possibly can, I will teach you some of the stunts I learned."
  "It's fine to see you; many thanks; and I will see you all soon."
