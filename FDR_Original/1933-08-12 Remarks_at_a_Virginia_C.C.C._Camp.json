  "Title: Remarks at a Virginia C.C.C. Camp"
  "It is very good to be able to visit these Virginia Civilian Conservation Corps camps. I hope that they are as inspiring all over 'the country as these I have seen today."
  "More important, I have seen the boys themselves, and all you have to do is to look at the boys themselves to see that the camps themselves are a success."
