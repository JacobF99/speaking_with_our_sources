  "Title: Informal Address at Bowdoin Farm"
  "More and more people are discovering that if they go to live on a farm they will never starve to death, while they may if they remain in the city. Of course, in the city they have a chance of becoming millionaires. But there are lots of things better than growing exceedingly rich, and one of them is having the assurance of a competence, of a sufficient living, of a good life and good neighbors."
  "You boys have a mighty fine chance at that assured life."
