  "Title: Remarks Announcing the Nomination of William Steele Sessions To Be Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"
  "Judge Sessions has established himself as a fair-minded, tough prosecutor and one of the finest Federal judges on the bench today. He's committed to protecting the rights of all Americans under the Constitution. He understands and has demonstrated unwavering dedication to constitutional principles in securing protection of the lives, the property, and the homes of our citizens, not only with respect to those who violate our laws but with respect to those who are charged with the responsibility of enforcing our laws. Under Judge Sessions' leadership, I'm confident that the FBI will continue its impressive tradition as one of the finest law enforcement agencies in the world, unmatched in integrity, commitment, and skill."
  "Judge Sessions. Mr. President, I thank you for reposing the confidence in me to become the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I look forward to trying to maintain the high standards that Judge Webster has provided for leadership in the Bureau, to working with Attorney General Meese as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and I'm grateful to you, sir. Thank you."
