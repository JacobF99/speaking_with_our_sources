  "The President. God bless you all, and thank you very much. And wouldn't you like to thank all these wonderful people too?"
  "Mrs. Reagan. Well, I don't know what to say. Thank you very, very much. I'm very touched—Foster Grandparent Program people and the Just Say No kids and everybody else. And I'm very, very happy to be home—very."

The President. Thank you all very much."
