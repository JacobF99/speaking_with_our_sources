  "Title: Remarks to Members of the Young Republican National Federation"
  "The President. But you know, I'm a latecomer. I'm a convert. And when I first became a Republican some years ago, I was always distressed because I never seemed to see many young people around. And now young people, ages 18 to 24, are the strongest group of all the groupings of people on our side in the country. Believe me, all of us here inside the beltway are most grateful to you. And stay with it. And whenever you talk to anyone else in your age group, the one thing they need to hear is: Come election time, go to the polls and vote! And —
Audience members. We love you!
The President.— if anyone—
Audience members. New York loves you!
The President.—if anyone tells you that we're just marking time for the next 22 months—the business that I used to be in said: Save something for the third act. And we will.
All right. Thank you all. God bless you."
