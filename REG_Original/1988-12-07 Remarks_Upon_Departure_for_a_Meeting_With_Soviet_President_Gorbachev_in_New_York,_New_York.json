  "Title: Remarks Upon Departure for a Meeting With Soviet President Gorbachev in New York, New York"
  "The pursuit of peace is, of course, always in season. But I think it's especially appropriate that President Gorbachev should be here at this time of year, a time when the thoughts and prayers of all of us turn to the hope that someday nations and people from every part of the world will live in peace and harmony with one another. It's for this reason that I journey to New York."
  "And thank you, and God bless you."
  "Soviet Military Reductions"
  "Q. Mr. President, what kind of troop reductions are being offered by the Soviets? Troop reductions by the Soviets?"
  "The President. Well, we're pleased to hear thatâ€”the fact that they're thinking in that term. We, too, have thought in it, and the idea of bringing conventional weapons down and achieving a symmetry between us, I think, would be another great forward step."
  "Yasser Arafat"
  "Q. Yasser Arafat?"
  "The President. Well, we haven't had time yet, because he held his press conference up until just a short time ago in Sweden, and we haven't had time to review what it is that he said there specifically. We're looking forward to do that."
  "I have to get going now. I can't be late for my luncheon."
