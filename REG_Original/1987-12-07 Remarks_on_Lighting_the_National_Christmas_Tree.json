  "Title: Remarks on Lighting the National Christmas Tree"
  "I hope the General Secretary is watching this on TV. I'd like him to see what we're celebrating, because for us, Christmas celebrates the cause of peace on Earth, good will toward men."
  "Peace on Earth, good will toward menâ€”I cannot think of a better spirit in which to begin the meetings of the next several days. As a small reminder of that spirit, the Star of Peace atop the National Christmas Tree will be lit day and night during the time our Soviet guests are here. And as we look out from the White House during our discussions, let the star remind us why we've gathered and what we seek."
  "In Luke, chapter 10, verse 5, we read: "Peace be to this house." That blessing is most appropriate over the next several days. And with that said, Tommy Valente will light the National Christmas Tree, and let the Star of Peace shine for all of us."
  "[At this point, the National Christmas Tree, which was located on the Ellipse, south of the White House grounds, was lighted.]"
  "Reporter. Mr. President, did you watch the arrival?"
  "The President. Yes."
  "Q. Do you have some new words for him?"
  "The President. No. He'll hear them in the morning."
  "Q. Bye."
  "Q. What will they be about, sir? New words on what?"
  "The President. Our meetings."
  "Q. Do you want a second treaty for a Christmas gift?"
  "The President. I'll take what we're going to have."
