  "Title: Remarks on Presenting the Fiscal Year 1989 Budget to Congressional Leaders"
  "And while meeting these domestic priorities and our national security needs, this budget does not increase taxes—again, consistent with our budget agreement. And these recommendations to the Congress, along with budget reform proposals, improve government management; and continued efforts toward privatization will continue the economic growth that we've all witnessed these past 5 years. And now I'm hoping we can work together through the budget process this year, sticking to our agreement and completing the appropriations process before the end of this fiscal year."
  "Republican Presidential Campaign"
  "Reporter. Mr. President, are you going to call in Senator Dole and Vice President Bush and give them a little lesson on the 11th Commandment? [Laughter]"
  "The President. I'm not going to talk about anything but the budget. [Laughter]"
  "Q. Are you pleased about the way the campaign's going on the Republican side at this point?"
  "The President. I'm—no comments."
  "Abduction in Lebanon"
  "Q. Sir, is there anything you can do for Colonel Higgins?"
  "The President. There, I have to tell you we're doing everything we can. We're trying to find out as much as we can, and we'll try to get him located. And certainly we want to rescue him."
  "Congressman Conte. You have a sizable increase in here for education, Mr. President—"
  "The President. Pardon?"
  "Congressman Conte. You have a sizable increase in this budget for education, and we want to thank you—some of us who have been fighting for it for many years now."
