  "Title: Remarks on Signing a Memorandum Directing Reductions in Federal Spending"
  "And no single action alone, I know, will get our economy back on the road to full recovery, but we must begin. And as with every other economic action we take, it's essential that we follow through on our commitments. Thus, I view the implementation of these orders as critical. The American people are determined, I believe, to have actions on the economic problems that we face. They're going to find out that we're listening to them. We're equally determined to see through every essential step that is needed to restore our economy."
  "So now, those four points that I made, that's what I am signing here today."
