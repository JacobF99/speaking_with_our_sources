  "Title: Remarks on Signing the Law Day U.S.A. Proclamation"
  "Our Declaration of Independence begins with an appeal to the laws of nature and of nature's God. Our Constitution proclaims that to establish justice shall be among the first of our priorities. And our history since has been replete with great men of law from Webster to Lincoln, Marshall to Holmes, who've played such major roles in our public life."
  "So, this is the heritage that we honor on May 1st of this year, as we have on the first of May for a quarter of a century. In other parts of the world, May 1st is used for a different kind of celebrationâ€”a forced, unnatural observance of a system that promises a freedom it systematically denies, proclaims justice while practicing tyranny, and uses what it calls law as little more than a thin veneer for the edicts of a totalitarian elite. We can and should be grateful to God that such is not true in America.
And I shall now sign the proclamation."
  "[At this point, the President signed the proclamation.]"
  "Reporter. Mr. President, is there any encouraging news from Secretary Haig this morning?"
  "The President. I don't know whether any reports have come in yet this morning. I haven't been in the office; I've been over there at another affair that's going on in the State Dining Room. So I'll go in and be finding out now."
  "Q. It sounds like your talk with President Galtieri yesterday was encouraging?"
  "The President. Yes. He called me, and he expressed over and over again his desire for a peaceful solution."
  "Q. Within the framework of 502, sir?
The President. Yes, that's what he said."
