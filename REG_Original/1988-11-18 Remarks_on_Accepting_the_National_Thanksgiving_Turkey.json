  "Title: Remarks on Accepting the National Thanksgiving Turkey"
  "The President.—and that this turkey's name is Woody. [Laughter] And Woody is not going to go on the platter. [Laughter] He's going to go back to Evans Mill—is that right?
Mr. Walts. Evans Farm Inn.
The President. Evans Farm.
Mr. Walts. It's a pet farm."
  "The President. Yes, where he'll stay and finally be able to grow up. [Laughter] Ooops! Well, Woody, it's nice to see you here."
  "Mr. Walts. Mr. President, we certainly appreciate you—
The President. Well. Mr. Walts. Actually, you'll be retiring January 20th, and I'll be retiring January 16th, so we're going out together. [Laughter]"
  "Mr. Hermanson. Thank you for 8 good years.
Mr. Walts. Absolutely.
The President. Thank you very much."
  "Mr. Hermanson. There's a lot of Iowa corn in that turkey.
The President. Yes."
