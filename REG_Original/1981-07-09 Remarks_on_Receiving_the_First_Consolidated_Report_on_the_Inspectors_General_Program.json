  "Title: Remarks on Receiving the First Consolidated Report on the Inspectors General Program"
  "The President. Well, you have more than my interest; you have my support and enthusiastic backing in this. I think it is high time. We've spoken of this over a period of time—going clear back to the campaign—of fraud, waste, and abuse. And I never was in sympathy with the way one department in government, some time ago, eliminated fraud, waste, and abuse. As I understand it, they called a staff meeting and said they would no longer use those words. They would now call it mismanagement and something else. [Laughter] Therefore, fraud, waste, and abuse disappeared."
  "But this is the way to go at it, and you sure do have our backing, and go get them."
  "Mr. Harper. Thank you very much, Mr. President. We know you have a very busy schedule, and we've got to get over to our meeting with the press. Thank you for your time."
  "The President. Well, thank you for what you're doing."
