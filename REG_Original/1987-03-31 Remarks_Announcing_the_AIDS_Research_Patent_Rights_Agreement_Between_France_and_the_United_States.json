  "Title: Remarks Announcing the AIDS Research Patent Rights Agreement Between France and the United States"
  "This agreement opens a new era in Franco-American cooperation, allowing France and the United States to join their efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes of speeding the development of an AIDS vaccine or cure. So, Mr. Prime Minister, Dr. Bowen, and Dr. Dedonder, we thank you all, and I hope this is just one of the many cooperative efforts between our two countries in the years ahead."
  "Jacques?"
  "The Prime Minister. Well, the President said what should be said. I just want to add how glad I am about this agreement to fight against this terrific disease. We in the United States and France have very, very good and efficient scientists, and they will now work together and also create a foundation to fight against AIDS. And it's, I think, a great step to be successful in this very important battle. And I'm very glad about it, and I thank very much the Department of Health of the United States and L'Institut Pasteur de Paris for all that they have done."
