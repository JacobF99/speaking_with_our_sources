  "Title: Remarks on Signing an Executive Order on Minority Business Enterprise Development"
  "Now, while our program for minority business development is important, it's by no means the most important of our efforts to promote this American dream for all our citizens. But beginning in the late sixties, on the very heels of the breakdown of legal racial barriers, the economy entered a period of contraction. And what it amounted to was that just when they achieved the rights to buy a ticket on the train—the economic train that they'd seen going by—got on the train, it started going backward."
  "So, this has been a problem. The actions taken, the proposals that have been made by this administration are designed to get the train moving again. And the signs are clear now that our program is working. And in addition, because of the progress of the 1960's and this administration's firm commitment to protect the human rights and the economic freedom of all Americans, the passenger list is going to look a little different when the train starts rolling ahead this time."
  "So, without any further ado, I am delighted to sign this Executive order."
