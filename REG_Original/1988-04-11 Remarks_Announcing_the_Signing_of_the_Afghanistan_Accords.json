  "Title: Remarks Announcing the Signing of the Afghanistan Accords"
  "This development would not have been possible had it not been for the valiant struggle of the Afghan people to rid their country of foreign occupation. We take great pride in having assisted the Afghan people in this triumph, and they can count on our continued support. We also pledge our continued friendship and support to the Government and people of Pakistan, who have so generously hosted millions of Afghan refugees during this period of Soviet domination of Afghanistan."
