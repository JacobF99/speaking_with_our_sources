  "Title: Remarks on Signing a Bill To Commemorate the Illinois and Michigan Canal"
  "We're pleased that this legislation enjoyed strong bipartisan support, including cosponsorship by Senator Dixon and the longtime support of Congressman Mel Price."
  "The legislation commemorates the Illinois and Michigan Canal, which was a main artery of commerce in the 19th century, by designating a National Heritage Corridor from Chicago to LaSalle-Peru, Illinois. The legislation also establishes a National Heritage Corridor Commission to assist local and State entities in any appropriate preservation treatment or renovation of the old structures of the canal. We believe such activity will stimulate tourism, jobs, and economic growth, as well as greater cooperation between local, State, and Federal Governments."
  "So, with that said, I am pleased to sign the bill."
