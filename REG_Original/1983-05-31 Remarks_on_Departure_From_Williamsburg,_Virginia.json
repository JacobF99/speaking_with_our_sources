  "Title: Remarks on Departure From Williamsburg, Virginia"
  "And I'm not just speaking now for our own country or our side, but I want you to know that all during this summit, the heads of state, who've now all embarked on their way home, repeatedly volunteered to me how wonderfully they were being treated, how warmly they were greeted by all of you here in the community, but also how their every need, whether it had to do with the business of the summit or whether it just was for their personal comfort, how every need had been met. And they were overwhelmed by this, plus the fact that they said they felt a great kinship and a part of now American history more so than they ever had before by virtue of having the meeting in this particular place and among all of you who have made this historic monument such a wonderful and spectacular place."
  "So, again I just, from the bottom of my heart, thank you not only for our own personal comfort and what you've done but you've made a sizable contribution to better international understanding. So, thank you again."
