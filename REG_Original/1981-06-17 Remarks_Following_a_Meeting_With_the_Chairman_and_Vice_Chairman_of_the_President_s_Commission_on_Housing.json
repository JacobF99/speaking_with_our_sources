  "Title: Remarks Following a Meeting With the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the President's Commission on Housing"
  "Home-ownership is the symbol of the family unit, the neighborhood, and is essential if we're going to have social, economic, and political stability in our land. The industry has been suffering from economic ups and downs, a roller coaster for the past two decades, and is suffering today. Our economic recovery program is the key, I think, to long-term recovery for that particular industry and for home-ownership in the land."
  "This Commission is going to be taking a hard look at all aspects of housing—financing, costs, construction, the Federal housing programs—and in addition, is going to look at how much government should be in housing, and come up with options for a national housing policy, and what we can do to maximize in the private sector home-ownership."
  "Well, Bill and Carla, you have a big job ahead of you, and I'm delighted that you'd take on that job."
  "Mr. McKenna. Mr. President, I appreciate your trust, and the job will be done.
Mrs. Hills. Thank you, Mr. President."
