  "Title: Remarks to Area Students in Columbia, Missouri"
  "Well, my thanks to all of you. You know, maybe what you all have achieved here with regard to your education setup, maybe I should take some of you back to Washington and we'd straighten out some of those puzzle palaces on the Potomac. Well, I thank you all very much for coming out. I know that I have to move on, we've got quite a busy schedule, but thank you all. Thank you for the musical greeting. I used to be a drum major in a band just like yours myself in Dixon, Illinois. Well, thank you all very much for coming out and for this warm welcome. God bless you all."
