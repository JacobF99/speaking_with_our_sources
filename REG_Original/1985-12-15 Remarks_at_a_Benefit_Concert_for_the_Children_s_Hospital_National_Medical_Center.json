  "Title: Remarks at a Benefit Concert for the Children's Hospital National Medical Center"
  "So, it's appropriate that in the Christmas season we honor the little children. Like the Savior who first appeared in this world a helpless infant, our children, in their vulnerability, innocence, and trust, carry the light of the world in their hearts. With our children, we literally hold the future in our arms. Let us follow the better angels of our nature and come to see this thing which the Lord has made known to us in the spirit of every little child."
  "Let me read a little more of that news account: "'And this shall be a sign unto you,' the angel said to the shepherds. 'Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.' And suddenly there was with the angel, a multitude of the heavenly hosts, praising God and saying, 'Glory to God in the highest, and on earth, peace, good will toward men.'"
  "Thank you again for all that you've done for the Children's Hospital. Let us find comfort and joy in our children and with them pray for peace on Earth and good will toward men.
Thank you, and God bless you all."
